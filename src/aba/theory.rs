/// Generate the logic for theory derivation in the given [`Aba`](crate::aba::Aba)
///
/// # Explanation
///
/// We will mainly operate on heads of rules here. So consider head `p` and all bodies `b`
/// in the set of all bodies of `p`: `bodies(p)`.
/// Every body `b` in `bodies(p)` is a set of atoms. Any set of atoms (any body) can be
/// used to derive `p`. So the following relation must hold:
/// - if `p` is true, at least one body `b` must be true aswell.
///   this only holds, because `p` itself is not assumption (since we're
///   only talking flat ABA)
/// - if `b` in `bodies(p)` is true, `p` must be true aswell
///
/// The entire logic in this function is required to implement this equality in DNF.
///
/// # Extra steps
///
/// - We do some extra work here to prevent atoms that never occur in the head of rule and
/// are not an assumption from ever being true.
/// - heads with a single body are common enough in practice to benefit from special care.
///   A lot of the overhead is due to the fact that multiple bodies are an option, if that's
///   not given for a head `p` we use the simplified translation logic where `p` is true iff
///   `bodies(p)` is true.
